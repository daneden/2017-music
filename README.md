# 2017 Music Project: Generative Art

For 2017, I decided to create a new piece of generative art each month as a
cover for the monthly playlists I was compiling on Spotify. This minisite is a
showcase of those pieces, with links to their corresponding playlists.

Visit it [here](https://daneden.github.io/2017-music/). Created with the
wonderfully helpful
[create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
