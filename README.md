# 2017 Music Project: Generative Art

For 2017, I decided to create a new piece of generative art each month as a
cover for the monthly playlists I was compiling on Spotify. This minisite is a
showcase of those pieces, with links to their corresponding playlists.

[Visit it here](https://2017-music.daneden.me/). Created with the
wonderfully helpful
